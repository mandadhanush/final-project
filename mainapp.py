Drusen is an Eye disease that is caused due to pollution and dust created by construction particles .This disease is mostly caused to the people who work in polluted areas. Due to this disease people can lose their eye site if the severity of the disease is high many works done the doctor are made automatic with the help of Artificial Intelligence. In the same way I have automated the drusen disease classification and deployed it on web application so that any user can use it .I have applied three deep learning algorithms namely VGG16, Convolution neural network, Resnet50 and compared the results of all the algorithms and deployed the suited .h5 model on to the front end share stream lit platform and deploy it on the cloud where it can be accessed by any person. In that web app a user can give the OCT image of eye retina membrane and can determine whether user has been effected by drusen disease or not effected. This solves the problem of doctorâ€™s scarcity and able to determine the results using technology.")
